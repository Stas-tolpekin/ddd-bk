# Introduction

I've helped numerous companies over the years to implement Angular-based large-scale enterprise applications. 

When implementing an Angular solution, it's vital to decompose the system into smaller libraries
 to reduce complexity. However, if this results in countless small libraries which are too intermingled, you haven't exactly made progress. If everything depends on everything else, you can't easily change or expand your system without breaking connections. 

Domain-driven design, and especially strategic design, helps. DDD can be the foundation for building microfrontends.

This book, which builds on several of my blogposts about Angular, DDD, and microfrontends, explains how to use these ideas.

## Thanks

I want to thank several people who have helped me write this book:

- The great people at [Nrwl.io](https://nrwl.io/) who provide the open-source tool [Nx](https://nx.dev/angular) used in the case studies here and described in the following chapters.
- [Thomas Burleson](https://twitter.com/thomasburleson?lang=de) who did an excellent job describing the concept of facades. Thomas contributed to the chapter about tactical design which explores facades.
- The master minds [Zack Jackson](https://twitter.com/ScriptedAlchemy) and [Jack Herrington](https://twitter.com/jherr) helped me to understand the API for Dynamic Module Federation.
- The awesome [Tobias Koppers](https://twitter.com/wSokra) gave me valuable insights into this topic and 
- The one and only [Dmitriy Shekhovtsov](https://twitter.com/valorkin) helped me using the Angular CLI/webpack 5 integration for this.
