# Introduction

I've helped numerous companies over the years to implement Angular-based large-scale enterprise applications. 

When implementing an Angular solution, it's vital to decompose the system into smaller libraries
 to reduce complexity. However, if this results in countless small libraries which are too intermingled, you haven't exactly made progress. If everything depends on everything else, you can't easily change or expand your system without breaking connections. 

Domain-driven design, and especially strategic design, helps. DDD can be the foundation for building microfrontends.

This book, which builds on several of my blogposts about Angular, DDD, and microfrontends, explains how to use these ideas.

If you have any questions or feedback, please reach out at ``book@softwarearchitekt.at``. I'm also on Twitter (https://twitter.com/ManfredSteyer) and Facebook (https://www.facebook.com/manfred.steyer). Stay in touch for updates about my Enterprise Angular work.

## Case Studies

This book explores the concepts by using case studies which you can find in my GitHub account:

- [Case Study for Strategic Design](https://github.com/manfredsteyer/strategic-design)
- [Case Study for Tactical Design](https://github.com/manfredsteyer/angular-ddd)
- [Case Study for Microfrontend Shell](https://github.com/manfredsteyer/angular-microfrontend)

## Help Improve this Book.

Please let me know if you have any suggestions. Send a pull request to [the book's GitHub repository](https://github.com/manfredsteyer/ddd-bk).

## Thanks

I want to thank several people who have helped me write this book:

- The great people at [Nrwl.io](https://nrwl.io/) who provide the open-source tool [Nx](https://nx.dev/angular) used in the case studies here and described in the following chapters.
- [Thomas Burleson](https://twitter.com/thomasburleson?lang=de) who did an excellent job describing the concept of facades. Thomas contributed to the chapter about tactical design which explores facades.
