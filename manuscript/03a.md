# Incremental Builds to Speed up Your CI Process

Having a huge solution leads to increased build times. This is a burden for many teams. To deal with this situation, Nx provides a great feature: Incremental Builds and Tests. That means, that only the changed libraries are rebuilt and retested in terms of unit and e2e tests.

<!-- ## Using Incremental Builds -->

To make use of incremental builds, make sure you create your libs with the ``--buildable`` or ``--publishable`` flag. The latter one is only needed if you plan to publish your libraries to an NPM registry. In all other cases go with ``--buildable`` because its faster:

```bash
ng g lib my-lib --buildable
```

For incremental builds, you need the Nx CLI. Install it via your package manager:

```bash
npm i -g @nrwl/cli
```

Then call ``nx build``:

```bash
nx build my-app --with-deps
```

This new switch compiles your libraries separately so that the individual libraries and applications can be cached. If you repeat this command, just the changed libraries are rebuilt -- the rest is taken out of your cache. Obviously, this speeds up your whole build:

The same is done for executing unit tests (``nx test``), e2e tests (``nx e2e``), and linting (``nx lint``). The ``nx.json`` in your project's root defines, which of those tasks use the cache:

```json
"tasksRunnerOptions": {
    "default": {
        "runner": "@nrwl/workspace/tasks-runners/default",
        "options": {
        "cacheableOperations": ["build", "lint", "test", "e2e"]
        }
    }
},
```

By default, the cache is on for all of them. If you wonder where to find the cache, have a look to your ``node_modules/.cache/nx`` directory.

## Using a Distributed Build Cache

If you want further speed up your whole build and CI process, you can use a distributed build cache. In this case you can benefit from tasks your colleagues already executed. Nothing needs to be done more than once within the whole team.

The smart people behind Nx provide an official solution for this called **Nx Cloud**. This commercial offering is available via AWS but also in the form of a private cloud offering. In the latter case you get a Docker container you can run and scale by yourself. 

The Nx Cloud provides several features: Besides a distributed cache it comes with a dashboard showing you the status of the operations performed. Also, it allows for parallel task execution for further speeding up build tasks, testing, and linting. For this, it distributes tasks to execute over several nodes. 

Besides this, you can also implement your own cache. In this case, you have to register it with a custom task runner. The latter one is not a big task as it can delegate 1:1 to the default implementation. Feel free to use the following skeleton for you own implementation:

```typescript
import { ProjectGraph } from '@nrwl/workspace/src/core/project-graph';
import { NxJson } from '@nrwl/workspace/src/core/shared-interfaces';
import { 
    DefaultTasksRunnerOptions, 
    defaultTasksRunner, 
    RemoteCache 
} from '@nrwl/workspace/src/tasks-runner/default-tasks-runner';
import { 
    AffectedEvent, 
    Task, 
    TasksRunner 
} from '@nrwl/workspace/src/tasks-runner/tasks-runner';
import { Observable } from 'rxjs';

// Your Custom Cache
class CustomRemoteCache implements RemoteCache {

    constructor(private someParameter: string) {
    }

    retrieve = (hash: string, cacheDirectory: string): Promise<boolean> => {
        [...]
    }

    store = (hash: string, cacheDirectory: string): Promise<boolean> => {
        [...]
    }
}

// Config Type for your Custom Cache
export type CustomTasksRunnerOptions = DefaultTasksRunnerOptions & {
    someParameter: string;
}

// Custom Task Runner registering your Custom Cache
// and delegating to the default task runner
export const customTasksRunner: TasksRunner<CustomTasksRunnerOptions> =
    (tasks: Task[], options: CustomTasksRunnerOptions, context?: {
        target?: string;
        initiatingProject?: string | null;
        projectGraph: ProjectGraph;
        nxJson: NxJson;
    }): Observable<AffectedEvent> => {

        console.debug('executing customTaskRunner');
        options.remoteCache = new CustomRemoteCache(options.remoteDirectory);
        return defaultTasksRunner(tasks, options, context);

    }

export default customTasksRunner;
```

With the CustomRemoteCache you can store and retrieve your task results, e. g. bundles or test results, in a cache of your choice. This could be a Redis cache, a MongoDB instance, a RDBMS, or just a REST service to just name a few.

The parameter ``someParameter`` just hints at how to provide parameters like the database connection string or a REST service's URL.

After implementing your task runner, you can register it with the ``nx.json``:

```json
"tasksRunnerOptions": {
    "default": {
        "runner": "./tools/task-runners/custom-task-runner",
        "options": {
        "cacheableOperations": ["build", "lint", "test", "e2e"],
        "someParameter": "whatever"
        }
    }
},
```
